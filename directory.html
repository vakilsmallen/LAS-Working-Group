<p><em>Updated and Reformatted for the Web in October 2014 by Conor Casey.</em></p>
<p><em>Updates in October 2016, and August 2019, and December 2019 by Conor Casey</em><br /><em>Contributions to several
        entries made by Crystal Rodgers as part of the Pacific Northwest Regional Labor Records Survey, Labor Archives
        of Washington during 2018-2021.</em></p>
<p><em>Updates made in Spring 2021 by members of the SAA Labor Archives Section Directory Working Group following
        creation of an directory entry submission form.</em></p>
<div class="WordSection2">
    <p>This directory updates work done in the early 1990s by the Wagner Labor Archives in New York City. A survey then
        conducted identified "archivists, librarians, and labor union staff who are collecting manuscripts, audio-visual
        materials, and artifacts that document the history of the trade union movement in the United States." Similarly,
        this directory includes repositories with partial holdings relating to labor and workers, as well as
        repositories whose entire holdings pertain to labor. Known updates were made in 2002, 2010 (James Quigel,
        editor), 2011 (Traci Drummond, editor), 2014, 2016, 2019 (Conor Casey, editor).</p>
    <p>The directory is organized by state, then by repository, with Canadian repositories listed last. Please contact
        the Labor Archives Section Directory Working Group of the Society of American Archivists, if you have additions,

    Foundation Library and Archive is affiliated with the Writers Guild of America labor union that represents
    screenwriters. They acquire manuscript collections from professional writers which contain scripts and other
    material, such as notes and correspondence, related to the craft and business of writing in the film and TV
    industry. Their 25 linear feet of labor union records represent a small part of their 200 collections, and provide
    some documentation about the founding and early days of the union in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Records document
    initial organizing efforts, the fight for NLRB certification, activities during the war and postwar period, the
    effort to unionize television writers, and the beginnings of the Blacklist. &nbsp;Guild documentation is also
    present in collections acquired from individual leaders and committee members spanning the 1920s through the 1990s.
    These document regular Guild business as well as multiple strikes and the work to correct the credits of Blacklisted
    writers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Non-paper material includes some photographs and video and audio recordings, including
    about 100 oral histories in which the history, challenges and achievements of the WGA (and its predecessor the
    Screen Writers Guild) are discussed. A dominant topic that recurs throughout the story of the WGA is the Hollywood
    Blacklist period of the late 1940s and 1950s which disproportionately affected screenwriters, many of whom had been
    involved in Communist or socialist movements in the 1930s.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notable collections include: WGA publications (newsletters and magazines) spanning the
    1930s to the present, and oral histories recorded with founders and leaders.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">The extensive labor collections in the CU Boulder Archives reflect
        Colorado’s stature as an historic epicenter of labor movements in the American West. Notorious, violent labor
        actions in Colorado, including those at Cripple Creek (1894), Leadville (1896-1897), Ludlow (1914), and the
        Columbine Mine (1927), as led by the Western Federation of Miners, United Mine Workers of America, and
        Industrial Workers of the World, contributed significantly to the development of national labor rights,
        including the 8-hour work day, 40-hour work week, child labor laws, and the dissolution of company towns.
        Colorado’s resulting pro-labor reputation continued to attract union organizers throughout the 1940s and 1950s,
        as the city of Denver became the national headquarters of the National Farmers Union (NFU) and the Oil,
        Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union (OCAW). The International Typographical Union (ITU) – one of
        the first unions in the United States, was formed in 1852.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The University of Maryland has emphasized the collecting of archival
        resources&nbsp;and other collections that document the history of the labor movement in North America and the
        Washington, DC/Maryland region for over fifty years. The Special Collections &amp; University Archives
        Department in the University of Maryland Libraries includes several major collecting areas: State of Maryland
        and Historical Collections, Mass Media &amp; Culture, Literature &amp; Rare Books, University Archives, and the
        Gordon W. Prange Collection. Until 2013, the State of Maryland and Historical Collections stewarded significant
        labor union collections and materials. With the acquisition of the entire George Meany Memorial Archive and
        Library, previously maintained at the National Labor College in Silver Spring, MD, a new collecting area,
        Special Collections in Labor and Workplace Studies, was established. Currently our labor collections consist of
        over 19,500 linear feet of archival material, and a library of 18,000 publications and 1,000 linear feet of
        labor journals and ephemeral publications. Note: A portion of the collection is stored off-site and may take one
        to two days to retrieve; many records are restricted – please contact us for information.</p>

        Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBCJA), UBCJA Local 132, and the archives of the Samuel Gompers Papers
        Project. The University of Maryland is the official repository for records of the American Federation of Labor
        (AFL), selected records of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and the merged American Federation of
        Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), including administrative and staff departments.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">These records date from the establishment of the AFL (1881), and offer almost
        complete records from the founding of the AFL-CIO (1955). The records provide rich resources for the exploration
        of economic, political and social issues relevant to workers in America, and internationally, and include the
        papers of Samuel Gompers (selected), William Green, George Meany, Gabriel Edmonston, Frank Morrison, William F.
        Schnitzler, John L. Lewis (selected), Donald Slaiman, William Pollard, Boris Shishkin, Frank Fernbach, Nat

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jo Labadie, founder of the Labadie Collection was the chosen agent for unionizing
        Michigan, and his contributions reflect his mission for the Knights of Labor and his switch to the American
        Federation of Labor in the 1880s. He became the first president of the Michigan Federation of&nbsp;Labor in
        1889. Although his anarchist convictions kept him from later official ties, he retained a lifelong interest in
        the objectives of labor unions and corresponded with many leaders, notably Samuel Gompers. The first Curator of
        the Collection, Agnes Inglis, was a supporter of the Industrial Workers of the World, and collected as much as
        possible connected with the Wobblies. The industrial union strategy of the C.I.O. interested Inglis, who
        collected many convention reports and other documents. She searched for records of industrial strife in all
        periods.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The collection covers predominately American labor struggles from the late 19th and
        early 20th century, into the 1930s. Post WWII materials concentrate mostly on protests against union leadership,
        democratic caucuses, and radical organizations of black workers. British labor materials cover chiefly the
        General Strike of 1926 and the National Minority Movement, a Communist effort to infiltrate the British Unions,
        as well as a collection of materials on the workers in the British coal mining industry in the 1970s and 80s.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The collection consists of monographs, serials, pamphlets, microfilm, sound
        recordings (in LP, audio cassette and CD format), song books, photographs, flyers, leaflets, broadsides,
        posters, newspaper clippings, notices of meetings, and union ephemera, such as buttons, badges and banners.</p>
